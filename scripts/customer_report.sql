/*
===============================================================================
Customer Report
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

Highlights:
    1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
	2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
    3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:
	   - total orders
	   - total sales
	   - total quantity purchased
	   - total products
	   - lifespan (in months)
    4. Calculates valuable KPIs:
	    - recency (months since last order)
		- average order value
		- average monthly spend
